# hibernate_relational_mapping

Hibernate despite being a powerful object to database field mapping library also offers extensive features for communicating and reading data from data tables.
In many cases, reading data directly from one table is not sufficient. You may need to join and conctenate tables and fields to pull the speicific data you seek. This use-case is why hibernate offers a powerful table joining feature.

Using this feature you can blend the object mapping with joins to pull robust data from disparate but related table.

This repository seeks to demonstrate this feature; particularly, the one-to-one (uni and bi-directional), one-to-many as well as many-to-many approach.

All the necessary details will be included in the source files for extensibility as well as contributions.
